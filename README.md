# Hi there 👋

I'm Kudzayi. I find myself at the intersection of networks, embedded systems, 
and cybersecurity — passionate about securing the connected world and building 
things that bridge the physical and digital.

I'm currently pursuing my MSc in Cyber-Physical Systems (IoT) at Northeastern 
University, where I also teach IoT Fundamentals and Embedded Systems as a 
Teaching Assistant. Thanks for stopping by!
